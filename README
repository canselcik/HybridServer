HybridServer is a lightweight server coded in Java that supports
handling a raw TCP connection as well as HTTP GET and HTTP HEAD
requests. It can serve to multiple clients but should not be
expected to serve to a large audience since it creates new threads
for every TCP session and HTTP request.

It was originally designed to constitute a mainframe for my dorm
automation system, and now I am uploading it on GitHub to share
it with anyone who would like to re-use the code or learn from it.
